# CS3 Case Study

This repository contains the study, deliverable, data, and reference materials necessary to complete the COVID-19 Twitter Reactions Case Study

In this project, you will take on the role of a public health data analyst during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Your mission is to explore how public sentiment varied depending on what people were tweeting about.

## Dataset Information

**File to use:**  
`data/df_us_sentiment.csv`

This dataset includes:
- `OriginalTweet`: The text of the tweet
- `Location`: General region where tweet originated
- `TweetAt`: The date of the tweet
- `Sentiment`: Pre-labeled as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**
- `VADER Score`: Numeric sentiment score from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive)

## How to Get Started

- Open a new Jupyter notebook (`your_analysis_here.ipynb`).
